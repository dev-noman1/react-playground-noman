## 🚀 About the Project

This repo contains all my **React learning experiments** and **hook practice projects**.  
I’m building this as my personal **React notes + mini projects hub**, where I explore:
- `useState`, `useEffect`, and advanced hooks
- API fetching & data handling
- Dynamic UI layouts
- Logic building with clean React structure

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (Vite)
- 🎨 CSS / Tailwind (in future)
- 🌐 FakeStore API for real data practice
- 💡 Pure JavaScript logic

## ⭐ Note

This repo is in **active progress** — not a one-time project.  
Expect **continuous updates**, **refactors**, and **new hooks/components** as learning expands.
